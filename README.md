The client was DriverPass, a company owned by Liam, with Ian serving as the IT officer. DriverPass wanted a system that helps students prepare for their driving tests through online practice exams and on-the-road training. The system needed to allow users to register for packages, schedule driving lessons, take practice tests, and track their progress. It also had to support multiple user roles, such as administrators, IT staff, secretaries, and students. Security, flexibility, and access from any device were key requirements. The system would be cloud-based, integrate with DMV updates, and maintain accurate scheduling and tracking of lessons and drivers.

I did a good job analyzing the client’s needs from the interview transcript and translating them into clear functional and nonfunctional requirements. My business requirements document clearly defined the goals, objectives, user roles, and technical expectations for the system. I also effectively used UML diagrams, such as the use case, activity, sequence, and class diagrams, to visually represent how the system would function. These diagrams showed how users interact with the system, helping bridge the gap between technical and nontechnical stakeholders.

If I could revise one part, I would improve the technical requirements section of my system design document. While I covered the basic hardware, software, and platform needs, I could have gone deeper into the security architecture—for example, by specifying encryption standards for user data, access control mechanisms, and how backups would be handled in the cloud environment. Adding this detail would make the design more complete and demonstrate stronger consideration for system protection and scalability.

I interpreted the user’s needs by carefully reviewing the interview transcript and identifying the tasks each user type (students, secretaries, IT officer, and owner) needed to perform. For example, I made sure students could register online, take practice exams, and book or cancel lessons, while staff could manage reservations, view reports, and handle password resets. Considering user needs is essential because the success of a system depends on how well it supports its real users. A design that ignores user needs can result in confusion, inefficiency, or even system failure. Prioritizing usability and functionality ensures that the final product meets business goals and provides a smooth experience for every user type.

When designing software, I start by gathering and analyzing requirements from clients and end users. Then, I create models and diagrams (like use case, sequence, and class diagrams) to visualize the system before any coding begins. I also ensure I apply both process modeling (to understand workflows) and object modeling (to represent real-world entities). In the future, I plan to use more iterative design methods, such as Agile modeling, to gather feedback early and adjust quickly. I will also use user stories, prototypes, and usability testing to make sure the final design aligns perfectly with user expectations.
